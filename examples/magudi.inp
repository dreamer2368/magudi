# magudi.inp
# Sample input file to magudi with a documented list of (almost) all parameters

# Notes:
# ======
# 1. Optional parameters are assigned their default values here.
# 2. If a parameter has a string value with a whitespace character, it is required to be
#    surrounded by quotes. In general, it is preferable to always use quotes.

# ==========================

# [optional] Prefix for saving data files. All files written by magudi contain data whose
# byte-ordering corresponds to the native endianness of the machine.
output_prefix = "magudi"

# [required] Relative/absolute path to a 3D multi-block whole format PLOT3D grid file to be
# used for the simulation. magudi automatically detects the endianness. The grid file may or
# may not contain IBLANK data.
grid_file = "magudi.xyz"

# [optional] Relative/absolute path to a 3D multi-block whole format PLOT3D solution file to
# be used as the initial condition for the predictive simulation. PLOT3D solution files
# contain an auxiliary header consisting of 4 real variables. magudi rounds the first
# auxiliary variable, which is assumed to be the timestep from which the simulation begins,
# and takes the last auxiliary variable to be the initial physical time. The second and third
# auxiliary variables are ignored. The behavior is undefined if the auxiliary variables are
# not the same across the blocks of a multi-block solution file. If this parameter is not
# specified, a quiescent state is used as the initial condition.
initial_condition_file = ""

# [optional] Relative/absolute path to a 3D multi-block whole format PLOT3D solution file to
# be used as the target state. Used only if the flag `use_target_state` is set to `true`. The
# primal solution is damped towards the target state at sponge zones. The target state is also
# used at far-field boundaries. The temperature field computed from the target state is also
# used as the boundary condition at isothermal no-slip walls. If this parameter is not
# specified and `use_target_state` is set to `true`, a quiescent state is used as the target
# state.
target_state_file = ""

# [required] Relative/absolute path to a text file containing boundary condition data. Each
# boundary condition defines a patch, which is a subset of grid points on a single specified
# block that forms the support for a simultaneous approximation term. Specialized patches can
# be used, for example, to simulate sponge zones or provide inflow excitation. The actuator
# and cost target regions are also defined as patches. Please see the example boundary
# condition file supplied with magudi for more information on the format of this file. In
# particular, the names of the patches specified in this file can be used here to specify
# patch-specific input.

# SECTION 2: Simulation flags
# ===========================

# [optional] When viscous terms are not included, magudi solves the Euler equations.
include_viscous_terms = false

# [optional] The adjoint solver is disabled by default, and magudi simply behaves like a
# predictive simulation tool.
disable_adjoint_solver = true

# [optional, unsupported] When viscous terms are included, this flag dictates
# whether they are computed using a repeated application of two first-derivative
# approximations, or with a narrow-stencil second-derivative approximation. By default,
# magudi uses repeated first-derivative approximations.
repeat_first_derivative = true

# [optional] This flag must be enabled if the simulation requires a target state, such as when
# sponge zones or far-field boundaries are present. If `true` and the parameter
# `target_state_file` is not specified, a quiescent state is used as the target state.
use_target_state = true

# [optional] Controls whether artificial numerical dissipation is added. The dissipation term
# is self-adjoint, and is added to the right-hand-side by both the primal and adjoint solvers.
# Reference: Mattsson, Ken, Magnus Svärd, and Jan Nordström. "Stable and accurate artificial
# dissipation." Journal of Scientific Computing 21.1 (2004): 57-79.
add_dissipation = false

# [optional] If `false`, off-diagonal metric transformation terms are not multiplied when
# transforming derivatives from computational to physical coordinates. This flag may be used
# to gain some computational speedup by avoiding unnecessary FLOPS when all the blocks in the
# grid are regular Cartesian.
curvilinear_domain = true

# [optional] If `true` the distribution of MPI tasks among the blocks of a multi-block grid
# and further along the computational directions of a multi-dimensional block are read from
# the text file specified by the `decomposition_map_file` parameter. For multi-block
# simulations where the relative number of grid points across blocks is skewed, it is
# preferable to set this parameter to `true` and use a manual decomposition map.
